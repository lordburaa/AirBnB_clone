## Background Context
## Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
## First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
 This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: `HTML/CSS templating`, `database storage`, `API`, `front-end integration`…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
# Requirements
